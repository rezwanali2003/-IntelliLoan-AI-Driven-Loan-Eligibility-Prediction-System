# IntelliLoan: AI-Driven Loan Eligibility Prediction System

## Overview

IntelliLoan is a sophisticated AI-powered system designed to predict loan eligibility with high accuracy and reliability. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, IntelliLoan analyzes various borrower data points to provide financial institutions with a robust tool for making informed lending decisions.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver precise predictions.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large datasets, suitable for both small and large financial institutions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use dashboard for loan officers and administrators.
- **Security**: Implements strong data protection measures to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Continuous Learning**: Periodically updates the model with new data to maintain optimal performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- git (version control system)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IntelliLoan.git
   cd IntelliLoan
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in CSV format with the appropriate columns (e.g., credit_score, income, employment_years, debt_to_income_ratio, loan_amount, collateral_value, employment_status, loan_purpose, eligible).

2. **Run the training script**:
   ```sh
   python train.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset.csv
   ```

3. **Save the model**: The trained model will be saved as `model.pkl`.

### Predicting Loan Eligibility

1. **Start the Flask app**:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Make a prediction**: Send a POST request to the API with borrower data.
   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"credit_score": 700, "income": 50000, "employment_years": 5, "debt_to_income_ratio": 0.3, "loan_amount": 10000, "collateral_value": 15000, "employment_status": "employed", "loan_purpose": "personal"}'
   ```

### Example Request

```json
{
  "credit_score": 700,
  "income": 50000,
  "employment_years": 5,
  "debt_to_income_ratio": 0.3,
  "loan_amount": 10000,
  "collateral_value": 15000,
  "employment_status": "employed",
  "loan_purpose": "personal"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "loan_eligibility": 1
}
```
